The following chart shows that non-elective case-mix was higher in 20/21 than in prior years. Possibly due to the impact of less watchful waiting

```{r Non-elective chart, echo = FALSE}
NELCharts <- readRDS("NELCharts.RDS")

NELCharts

```

The next chart shows that elective case-mix was lower in 20/21 than in prior years during the lockdown months. Possibly due to avoiding complex patients who would be at higher risk of COVID.

```{r Elective chart, echo = FALSE}
ELCharts <- readRDS("ELCharts.RDS")

ELCharts

```
